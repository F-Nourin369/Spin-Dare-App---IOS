**##Spin Dare**
A customizable and interactive dare game for friends, built with SwiftUI.

**About the App**
Spin Dare is a digital twist on the classic "Spin the Bottle" game. Instead of just picking a person, each player contributes a custom dare, and the spinning bottle randomly selects a question for a player to complete. It's the perfect way to add some fun and excitement to any gathering.

**Features**
Customizable Players: Easily set the number of players for each game.

Player-Submitted Dares: Each player can enter their own unique dare question, ensuring every game is fresh and unpredictable.

Interactive Bottle: A visually appealing, rotatable bottle that you can spin with a touch gesture.

Random Selection: The app randomly selects and displays a player's dare question after the bottle lands.

Clean UI: A simple and intuitive user interface designed with SwiftUI.

**How to Play**
Start a Game: Launch the app and enter the number of players.

Submit Dares: Pass the device around, and each player will enter their own dare question.

Spin the Bottle: Tap and drag the bottle in a circular motion to spin it.

Complete the Dare: When the bottle stops, a random dare will be displayed. The player whose turn it is must complete the dare!

**Technology**
This application is built using the following technologies:

SwiftUI: Apple's declarative framework for building user interfaces.

Swift: The powerful and intuitive programming language for macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS.
