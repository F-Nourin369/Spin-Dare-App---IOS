Darely
</p>

Spin Dare is a digital twist on the classic "Spin the Bottle" game. Instead of just picking a person, each player contributes a custom dare, and the spinning bottle randomly selects a question for a player to complete. It's the perfect way to add some fun and excitement to any gathering.
